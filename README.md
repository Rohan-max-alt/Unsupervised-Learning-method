# Unsupervised-Learning-method
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. 
These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.
Here we have performed Clustering because the output is not known so to categorize the data we do unsupervised methods.

Please reffer kaggle code and take Datasets from kaggle because you might get free source of datasets.
I have taken all the Datasets so far from kaggle website. 

Thank You!
